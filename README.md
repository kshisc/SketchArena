# Sketch Arena

Our project is a web application for a drawing and guessing game, named Sketch Arena, with multiple players in multiple game rooms. Players take turns drawing on a drawing board while everyone else attempts to guess the drawing through typing in the chat in real-time. We implemented user login functionality, a chatroom using websockets, and multithreading to allow simultaneous game rooms.

We used Eclipse as our IDE, Github for version control and collaboration, MySQL to store the player data and work bank, JDBC to connect to the database, and Tomcat to host our web application. For the frontend, we used Figma for our UI design, React, JSX with Typescript, and CSS for the code, Node.js and Vite to build, and Axios for HTTP requests. For the backend, we coded everything in Java and used the Gson library to help serialize the data into Json.
